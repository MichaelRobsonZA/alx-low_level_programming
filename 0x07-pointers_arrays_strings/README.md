<h1>C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings</h1>
<p>This project contains a collection of C scripts that perform various operations on pointers, arrays, and strings.</p>
<h2>0-memset.c</h2>
<p>The <code>_memset()</code> function fills the first n bytes of the memory pointed to by s with the constant byte b and returns a pointer to the memory area s.</p>
<h2>1-memcpy.c</h2>
<p>The <code>_memcpy()</code> function copies n bytes from the memory area src to the memory area dest and returns a pointer to dest.</p>
<h2>2-strchr.c</h2>
<p>The <code>_strchr()</code> function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found.</p>
<h2>3-strspn.c</h2>
<p>The <code>_strspn()</code> function returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept.</p>
<h2>4-strpbrk.c</h2>
<p>The <code>_strpbrk()</code> function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept and returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found.</p>
<h2>5-strstr.c</h2>
<p>The <code>_strstr()</code> function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack and returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.</p>
